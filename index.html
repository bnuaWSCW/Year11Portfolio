        Hello, my name is Brandon Nua, a student in Western Springs college, creating a portfolio for my Digital Technologies school subject. I am ever learning HTML, coding, animations and 3D modelling in Digital Technologies, and have gained an interest in the satisfactory feeling of completing a problem/syntax in such activities. I have an interest in other subjects such as sports activities, gaming and music, and strive for excellence in whatever task I do.
