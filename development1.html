    <div id="widothis1">
        <p class="endusers1">From looking at the turn around character. There are some changes needed to be made, but I am content with the drawing as it is. 
        </p>
        <p class="endusers1">In relation to complying with the requirements of end users, I think that the proportions of the shoulders can be tweaked down a little. Additionally, I assumed that the physical clothing on my character needed to be on the character. In the future, I will need to ignore the accessories in my character. The more easily noticable feature that needs to be worked on is the general quality of my drawing. The characters legs are not noticable enough, and the side view is not proportioned realistically(if it were real life, the character would fall over). Though there is some work pertaining to quality, that is an acquired skill I don't have</p>
        <p class="endusers1">Though my artwork limits my turn around drawing, I think that there is other attributes to the drawing that I am content with. Though some proportions need to be worked on, you are able to see the general idea that the character is a human. Additionally, my drawing is well within the proportions of a real human, complying with the implications in the design considerations.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="endusers1"><i>"Yes I think that your character has realastic proportions for a human, because I looked at the head measurement of your character and compared them to the head measturements template on Google Classroom"</i></p>
    <p class="endusers1"><i>"No, this is because the torso is not in proportion to the other parts like the limbs. "</i></p>

    <h2 class="questions"><b><u>My Low Poly Character is a human - more specifically an athlete. How do you think I am able to make this character more realistic - in relation to an athlete?</u></b></h2>
    <br>
    <p class="endusers1"><i>"I think that you can make you character look more like an athlete my giving him more defined muscles instead of just blocks for his body"</i></p>
    <p class="endusers1"><i>"Most athletes that are runners are really skinny but might have long large leg muscles - in which this character does not achieve."</i></p>

    <div id="wireframside">
        <p class="endusers1">In terms of improving my turn around low poly character using the feedback I got, I tried to look at their perspective I make such comment. As said in the feedback, yes I did have characteristics that pertain to realistic proportions, but it didn't fit the objective of making an athlete. Additionally, the second student that I sought for for feedback stated that my torso was not in proportion. As I look at his perspective, I saw that the torso is too blocky, not centred and doesn't compliment my overall objective of an athlete.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="endusers1">For my improvements, I searched additional images of what a athlete truly looks like, and added more inspiration from that with the feedback I got. I redrew the torso to curve like a part of a circle to address the blocky nature it has. Additionaly, I tried to manipulate the body so that it is centred. Throughout all of this, I kept in mind my feedback I got as well as my researched athlete.

    <p class="endusers1">It was crucial to gain this feedback, as my personal feedback did not see the overall imperfections of my turn around character. Note: the picture above is not the improved version of my turn around character. I did not have time to rescan the improved picture.
