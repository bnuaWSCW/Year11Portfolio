        </p>
        <p class="endusers1">In relation to complying with the requirements of end users, I think that the proportions of the shoulders can be tweaked down a little. Additionally, I assumed that the physical clothing on my character needed to be on the character. In the future, I will need to ignore the accessories in my character. The more easily noticable feature that needs to be worked on is the general quality of my drawing. The characters legs are not noticable enough, and the side view is not proportioned realistically(if it were real life, the character would fall over). Though there is some work pertaining to quality, that is an acquired skill I don't have</p>
        <p class="endusers1">Though my artwork limits my turn around drawing, I think that there is other attributes to the drawing that I am content with. Though some proportions need to be worked on, you are able to see the general idea that the character is a human. Additionally, my drawing is well within the proportions of a real human, complying with the implications in the design considerations.</p>

        <p class="endusers1">In terms of improving my turn around low poly character using the feedback I got, I tried to look at their perspective I make such comment. As said in the feedback, yes I did have characteristics that pertain to realistic proportions, but it didn't fit the objective of making an athlete. Additionally, the second student that I sought for for feedback stated that my torso was not in proportion. As I look at his perspective, I saw that the torso is too blocky, not centred and doesn't compliment my overall objective of an athlete.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="endusers1">For my improvements, I searched additional images of what a athlete truly looks like, and added more inspiration from that with the feedback I got. I redrew the torso to curve like a part of a circle to address the blocky nature it has. Additionaly, I tried to manipulate the body so that it is centred. Throughout all of this, I kept in mind my feedback I got as well as my researched athlete.

As said in the feedback, my head wasn't part of this '3 part' head structure, so I will make changes accordingly. I will also dwindle down the middle part of the head(inaccordance with the first feedback). Additionally, I will be looking at the neck with the head to see if they're any mistakes in relatability there. Though they say there is some imperfections in my characters head, they have around the same thoughts as me - the head is acceptable at least.</p>
        <p class="endusers1">For my improvements, I searched additional images of what a athlete's neck looks like in accordance to the second person's feedback - I didn't find much.

I looked back at the reference sheet with the head to see if they're any mistakes I did, and I found none or little mistakes that weren't noticable enough to change.

        <p class="endusers1">From looking at the actual animation in Blender, I am both content yet annoyed with the animation - in particular relating to rigging..
        </p>
        <p class="endusers1">In relation to complying with the requirements of end users, I actually think that the animation is semi-realistic. Apart from the complications in which I will state below, the general animation was to keep the leg up high at 90 degrees at its peak, the leg to the bum behind, the arm at 90 degrees behind the body and the arm close to the chest in the front. Usain Bolt was interviewed online about the techniques of how he runs fast. He stated those four things to create more speed. In complying with my end users, I used this tool and advice to steer the animations movement. I think that this went pretty well in comparision with the animation as a whole.</p>
        <p class="endusers1">In terms of generally tweaking the animation - I want it to be smooth. A complication that made the animation so blocky was the fact that my rigging of the bones were somehow inverted compared to the body. This is prominent in my character and animation. This also limited how high I can bring the leg. If I were to bring the leg too high, the leg would come back to normal - that would be positive but that would mean the animation would also go back to normal and create a nonhuman like movement. Additionally, when complying with the instructions of the animation, if I were to reverse and copy and paste the animation to the second half of the sequence, it would invert and change drastically. This meant that I also had to do the animation manually, making the whole animation blocky.
            In terms of me finding a solution to this and making the animation smooth, I would simply need to put my head down, and tweak most of the frames accordingly.

            Though I am not able to show the end result of my animation, I am able to say that I have successfully uphelded my piers feedback as well as my critiques. In the animation, I first uphelded the blocky movements by trying to go frame by frame analysis to see what was wrong. I did this both the legs and the arms. Although it is still blocky and has this fast movement and slow movement in between intervals, that is out of my control due to the unknown mistake I made that inverted the rigging of the armature. There is still a noticable spot in the animation that easily shows when the loop ends and starts, but same with the pacing of the animation, I cannot control the variability of the start and end. As a result of putting my head down and scaning each individual frame, the animation pace became slower, in which also intensifies the noticability of the start and end loops. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="endusers1">
            Overall though, I'd say I have uphelded my critque as well as my piers critque to the fullest of my ability. Although I could say I should've done better, I am content with how it looks considering my unknown blunder. In relation to my end user, I still think I have uphelded their requirements. For research purposes or for even relatability, I still uphelded the color(end result not shown here), the average height, and a researched technique of how to efficiently run at that level.
