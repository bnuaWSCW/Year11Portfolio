            The image to the left shows my low poly character turn around - featuring the front view and the side view. Additionally, the arms are separated to fully see the actual arms without any overlay.

        <p class="endusers1">From looking at the turn around character. There are some changes needed to be made, but I am content with the drawing as it is. 
        </p>
        <p class="endusers1">In relation to complying with the requirements of end users, I think that the proportions of the shoulders can be tweaked down a little. Additionally, I assumed that the physical clothing on my character needed to be on the character. In the future, I will need to ignore the accessories in my character. The more easily noticable feature that needs to be worked on is the general quality of my drawing. The characters legs are not noticable enough, and the side view is not proportioned realistically(if it were real life, the character would fall over). Though there is some work pertaining to quality, that is an acquired skill I don't have</p>
        <p class="endusers1">Though my artwork limits my turn around drawing, I think that there is other attributes to the drawing that I am content with. Though some proportions need to be worked on, you are able to see the general idea that the character is a human. Additionally, my drawing is well within the proportions of a real human, complying with the implications in the design considerations.</p>
