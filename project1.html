    <h2 class="nametitle">Overview</h2>
    <br>
    <div class="outcontent">
        <p style="font-size: 35px;">This project is my first project of 2024 - showing the 3D Low Poly Character I've created in 11DGT. This includes a running animation -
             requiring legs and arms. Within the contents of this low poly character, I've intended to design and create a realistic athlete doing a 100 metre sprint. A source for this 'realistic' character is myself, seeing my dimensions in the design. 
             Design considerations and development are included.

    <div class="endusers">
        <p>
            My end users are teenagers or track athletes. My overall idea of my Low Poly Character is a simple character(reference for the character is myself) acting as an athlete, preparing to run a 100 metre sprint. Teenagers are scientifically emotionally minded rather than logically minded - 
            generally a faster paced animation can address this. Additionally, making my character stereotypically a male that is around teenager height can create a relatable character for my end users. Me, being the reference for the character, can address this as I am a teenager - the dimensions should be related to my age. As well as addressing teenagers with relatable dimensions and a fast paced animation, athletes also relate to such attributes.
            The colour of my character isn't necessarily important nor hard. Teenagers or track athletes need a simple colour palette to not show diversity between real life running and my animation. Making my character wear athletic clothes also addresses my end users.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Overall, a realistic colour palette, a smooth and realistic animation as well as a relatable height are all things to consider when designing my low poly character.
            Realistic Colour Palette: Green and yellow are my chosen colour combinations. This is because it pertains to the colours of Western Springs and more importantly, green and yellow are most discernible and the easiest on the eyes when looking at them. This could potentially positively impact my end users experience, especially teenagers.
            Dimensions: 170 cm - this is the average height of teenagers. With keeping this in mind, as using myself as a reference, I may increase the height within reason. Due to this, 175 cm should be a suitable height when relating the height to the average teenager with the reference is myself.
            Smooth and Realistic Animation: When catering to both teenagers and athletes, a fast and realistic sprint when animating is an important consideration to remember. Additionally, another purpose for making such a character is for research purposes. Athletes may want an example of an efficient sprint. I could address this by making the animation of the run as realistic as possible, using outside sources as inspiration.
            Other general specifications such as functionality and aesthetics are things that cater towards my end users, and will be addressed down below.
