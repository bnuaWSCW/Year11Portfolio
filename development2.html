    <div id="wireframside">
        <p class="endusers1">There are numerous improvements I did to the hangman game from the feedback I got. From the feedback, I saw that the players could not see their guessed letters, what the word was in the end and their actual chances left before failure.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="endusers1">In terms of improving everything my feedback mentions, I could do some things and miss out others. Although we have a miniture picture of a hangman in the game, we cannot add pictures to the game. This is becuase of my ability to code pictures in, and is generally unrelated to the hangman game. Additionally because of the feedback given, I had added both a lives left counter and a list of all the guess words. This was to ensure players aren't confused with what letters they've used and what they haven't used. Additionally, I spaced out not only the guessing functions, but most of the games clustered sentences. An example can be the losing message being too clustered.
        </p>
        <p class="endusers1">In terms of adding in additional lines of code to accomodate multiple lettered guesses, it would be challenging as a new learner to get past certain if or elif statements. Additionally, single lettered guesses promote authenticity - having true results and true wins for players actually trying to win. Adding in a line of code that bypasses multiple letter guesses can deminish the game if they were to guess the whole alphabet. This line of code promote validity and true results when playing.</p>
