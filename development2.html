I expect after typing in "1", it shouldn't break because of try and except and it will not add the 1 into the list. After entering in "a", it should add it to the list and repeat the question.

    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <div id="wireframside">
        <p class="endusers1">There are numerous improvements I did to the hangman game from the feedback I got. 
            From the feedback, I saw that the players could not see their guessed letters, what the word was in the end and their actual chances left before failure.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="endusers1">In terms of improving everything my feedback mentions, I have done some things and missed out on others. 
            Although we have a miniture picture of a hangman in the game, we cannot add pictures to the game. 
            This is becuase of my ability to code pictures in, and is generally unrelated to the hangman game. 
            Additionally because of the feedback given, I had added both a lives left counter and a list of all the guess words.
             This was to ensure players aren't confused with what letters they've used and what they haven't used. 
             Additionally, I spaced out not only the guessing functions, but most of the games clustered sentences. An example can be the losing message being too clustered.
        </p>
        <p class="endusers1">In terms of adding in additional lines of code to accomodate multiple lettered guesses, it would be challenging as a new learner to get past certain if or elif statements. 
            Additionally, single lettered guesses promote authenticity - having true results and true wins for players actually trying to win. 
            Adding in a line of code that bypasses multiple letter guesses can deminish the game if they were to guess the whole alphabet with one guess. This line of code promote validity and true results when playing.</p>

What I understand of the code is that: for 5 times(going down 4, 3, 2, 1, 0), it will check if guess is correct. If guess is correct in atleast one spot, it will set placeholdlist(which is a list of "_") to that set number and set that particular underscore in the list to that guessed letter. 
                    Afterwhich it will print the whole of placeholdlist.
                    <br>
                    There were many problems and challenges within making this particular part of the code, at some times I replaced for i range(5) with 5 separate variables set to if statements if the guess one of the 5 variables. With Medy and online help, I was able to use this code.

        <p class="endusers1">For my improvements when keeping in mind the feedback that I've been given, I have first implemented more in the vocabulary around the game. When incorrect guesses are made, I made a simple hint for using vowels first. Additionally, I have implemented and imporved more sentences in the game process function - ensuring better engagement with the players, especially our end-users. In terms of the spacing around the game, I have implemented new lines respectively around the whole game, including the starting and ending functions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="endusers1">An additional critique mentioned in the feedback I was given was the lack of appreciation for displaying the guessed letters. It was stated that the bundled letters impaired the enjoyability and usability of the game, and compromised their ability to play the game. For acting upon this specific feedback, I looked up a way to somewhat organise the list of letters into atleast a grammatically correct sentence. ", ".join() was the function I found that simply joined a comma to each of the values in the list. This is a simple way I tried to implement usability and aesthetics into displaying the guessed letters.
