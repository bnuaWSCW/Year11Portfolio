    <h2 class="nametitle">Overview</h2>
    <div class="outcontent">
        <p>
            This python created hangman mini is my second project of 2024 - showing what I have done in term two in 11DGT. 
            This includes a hangman drawing, introductions, outros, functions and comments in the python language. 
            My intended end users are children - design considerations and development are included.

        <p>
            My end users for my hangman minigame are prominently primary children from ages 5 to 11. A word guessing game like hangman where you have to guess specific letters and words can help children get more of a grasp of literature and english, and can help them with understanding their school work. According to FasterCapital, hangman can help improve vocabulary and spelling, help learn new words and meanings, and can help grammar skills. Because of its major and important benefits to children, it is crucial that we are able to cater towards them and their interest in the game. 
            To do this, we can look at what they like at their age. Childrens’ brains are scientifically more emotionally sensitive than adults - making the game easy to understand is crucial for their attention span. 
            We can address this by using childish vocabulary, using personal pronouns, congratulating successful guesses, encouraging the user when there are unsuccessful guesses, and continuously cheering them on. Through this, our end users may find it emotionally pleasing, and will benefit from playing the game. We can also cater towards my end users from the presentability of the game as a whole. An actual drawing of the hangman getting drawn can intrigue the children more to complete the game, and does cater towards their sensitive emotions. 
            Other minor things such as clear spacing between sentences and clear instructions and rules can stop my end users from being confused on what to do, and does somewhat cover their emotional sensitivity. Finally, asking if they would like to play may seem unrelated to the enjoyability of end users, but can give efficiency to the playability of the game to the end users.
            Constantly ending the run than starting the code back up may seem repetitive, and does not cater towards my end users. Typing in a play again function can ease the possibility of boredom, and does genuinely have some sort of part to play in the enjoyment of my group's game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, childish vocabulary, using personal pronouns, congratulating successful guesses, encouraging the user, cheering the end users on, having a drawing of the hangman, clear and readable spacing between sentences, having clear instructions and rules and having a play again function are all including(but not limited to) specifications that cater towards my end users, and the success of my groups minigame depends on these specifications being upheld.
        </p>
        <p>Other general specifications and implications such as functionality and aesthetics are things that also cater towards my end users, all will be addressed down below.</p>
